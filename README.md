# EEP-225-Electrical-Machines

My lecture notes for electric machines course in spring 2022 in faculty of engineering, Alexandria University.

Considered as one of the most challenging courses in the ECE program, the goal of these documents is helping ECE students to understand, study and pass this course successfully.

Lecture notes are written in Latex, the contents is basically from lectures on campus or from the professor's slides.
